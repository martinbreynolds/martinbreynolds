### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# It's good of you to drop by...

## A bit about me..

I have had an interest in web and web development for the last 20 years.  During the summer I started to take my learning up a level and self taught myself some PHP and increased my skills in HTML, CSS and SCSS.  Using the skills I learnt I built my wife a website for her business, [Charlie's Gents Barbers](https://www.charliesbrighouse.com), using wordpress, with a fully custom theme.

I currently work as an office coordinator for a small local charity which supportds families with disabled children, and have a strong interest in accessible web applciations.

# Keeping the mind and body healthy.

I enjoy running and run with a local running club.  I took up running in 2018 and I ran my first ever marathon in October 2020.  Along with my marriage and children, this is one fo my greatest achievements and really tested the mind and body.  I am a FA qualified coach and coach my little boys team, truly testing but extremely rewarding.  I enjoy playing golf when I can, as well as the odd glass of bourbon to relax.


# Skills I have.

As part of my role with the charity, I look after the social media, print media and website.  Along the way I have had to self teach myself lots of skills, including Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Premier Pro and After Effects.


Thanks for dropping by...
